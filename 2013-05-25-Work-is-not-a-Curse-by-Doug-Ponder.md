#### **Work Is Not a Curse**

Imagine paradise. Really. Take a moment imagine you are in paradise. What do you see? Maybe you picture a remote tropical island with water clearer than a swimming pool. You can almost feel your toes sinking into the white sands warmed by the sun. Or maybe you imagine yourself reclining in an over-sized Adirondack chair. The fire in the stone hearth provides the perfect respite from the crisp mountain air as you curl up to spend the day reading a book.

Though pictures of paradise will vary from one person to another, one thing seems to remain constant in them all: just about everyone agrees that ‘paradise = freedom from work.’ Everybody but God, that is.

In the beginning, God created work. It’s true. One of the first things we learn about how God made us is that he designed us for work. “Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it” ([Gen. 1:28](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/1-28.html)), God said. And just so we didn’t miss his point, the author tells us, “The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden _to work_ it and take care of it” ([Gen. 2:15](http://www.biblestudytools.com/genesis/2-15.html)).

That’s not just some past-tense paradise, either. The biblical prophets also describe the future paradise being prepared for God’s people as a time when people turn their weapons of war into farming tools ([Isa. 2:1-5](http://www.biblestudytools.com/isaiah/passage.aspx?q=isaiah+2:1-5); [Micah 4:1-5](http://www.biblestudytools.com/micah/passage.aspx?q=micah+4:1-5)). So, the Bible begins with humans working in paradise and it ends with humans working in paradise!

In light of all this it should be obvious that _work_ _is not a curse_. Instead, God shows us that work is part of his perfect design for our lives. But what does this mean?
