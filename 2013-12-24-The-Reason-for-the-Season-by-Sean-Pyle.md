#### The Most Wonderful Time of the Year

Christmas is my favorite time of the year. I love everything about it. My wife and I put our Christmas tree and decorations up on November 1st this year and I have been listening to Christmas music since before Halloween. I may have even sampled my Christmas music selection once or twice at some point during the summer (don’t judge me!). There is just something about Christmas; people share a heightened sense of enjoyment and excitement during this time of year.

#### **Christmas is Crazy**

As much as I love Christmas, it is one of the busiest times of year for me. We are closing out the year for the church, preparing for a new rotation of volunteers in January, planning a Christmas Eve service—all this on top of the normal demands for everyone’s Christmas season. (You know, things like countless tacky sweater parties and family gatherings to plan for and attend.) Life doesn’t slow down at Christmas; it just gets crazier.

Recently, my wife noticed I was acting distant, emotionless (more so than usual). She asked me what was wrong with me. I told my wife that I felt like a robot, like I was just going through all the motions. I was simply performing tasks that had to be done, but was struggling to see purpose. I had hit a wall. I had no joy. In the craziness of the season, I had forgotten the reason for everything. I had forgotten what Christmas is all about.

#### **The Reason for the Season**

In the craziness of Christmas I had lost my joy. Maybe you have too. Maybe, like me, you’ve let the things we do around this time of year eclipse the entire reason for the season. (I know, it’s sounds so cheesy and cliché. But it’s true.) In other words, we have forgotten the good news of the gospel. This is the only thing that will keep us from losing our joy: Jesus, the Son of God, humbled himself and left his throne to come save us from our sins (Matt. 1:21). The King, from whom and for whom all things have been made, came to save us from our sins. It is for this reason we sing these glorious words:

_Joy to the World, the Lord has come!_  
_Let earth receive her King._  
_Let every heart prepare him room,_  
_And heaven and nature sing!_

_Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!_  
_Let men their songs employ._  
_While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains,_  
_Repeat the sounding joy._

_No more let sin and sorrow grow,_  
_Nor thorns infest the ground!_  
_He comes to make His blessings flow_  
_Far as the curse is found._

_He rules the earth with truth and grace,_  
_And makes the nations prove_  
_The glories of his righteousness_  
_And wonders of his love!_

For unto us a son was born, and his name is Immanuel, God with us. He has saved us from our sins! He has reversed the curse of Adam. He has conquered death. He will make all things new.

That is what we celebrate at Christmas and all throughout the year. That is the good news that brings true joy for all people. Don’t let the craziness of Christmas steal your joy. Remember Jesus, the reason for the season.
